    HOW TO INSTALL SMASH
  ========================

  To install SMASH, a fortran compiler, BLAS, LAPACK, and MPI
  (optional) libraries are required.
  If your machine is not a x86-64/Linux system or does not include
  an MPI library, choose an appropriate Makefile. Make sure that
  the compiler and library setting (F90, LIB, OPT) in the Makefile
  are correct, and then type the following command to build SMASH.

    (x86-64 with MPI)
      $ make

    (x86-64 with Intel MPI (mpiifort))
      $ make -f Makefile.mpiifort

    (x86-64 without MPI)
      $ make -f Makefile.noMPI

    (Supercomputer Fugaku or FX1000/700 with MPI)
      $ make -f Makefile.fujitsu

  If it is successfully completed, you can find the bin/smash file.
