  About SMASH
  -----------
  Scalable Molecular Analysis Solver for High-performance computing systems 
  (SMASH) is massively parallel open-source software for quantum chemistry.
  It is currently capable of energy, analytical gradient, and geometry
  optimization calculations of Hartree-Fock theory, Density Functional
  Theory (DFT), and Second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory.
  DFT calculations can be performed on 100,000 CPU cores with high parallel
  efficiency. The Fortran 90/95 language is used with MPI and OpenMP for
  inter-node and intra-node parallelization, respectively. Supported
  platforms are x86-64/Linux with Intel, NVIDIA HPC SDK (ex-PGI), or GNU
  compilers, and Supercomputer Fugaku and FX1000/700 with Fujitsu compiler.
