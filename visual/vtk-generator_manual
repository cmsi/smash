  SMASH VTK-GENERATOR
  -------------------
  The vtk-generator in SMASH generates a vtk file to visualize MOs from a checkpoint file.

  INSTALLATION
  ------------
  To compile the vtk-generator, use the Makefile in the same directory.
  Make sure that the integer sizes and endianness of SMASH and
  vtk-generator are correct.

    $ make

  HOW TO USE VTK-GENERATOR
  ------------------------
  In a SMASH calculation, create a checkpoint file
  (See Input format 2.2 in doc/User_manual).
  The vtk-generator requires four argments.
    1. checkpoint file
       Name of the checkpoint file.
    2. vtk file
       Name of the vtk file to be generated.
    3. MO type
       Type of MO to be visualized.
       MO or MOA : Alpha MO
       MOB       : Beta MO
    4. MO number
       HOMO, LUMO, or integer.

    ex) $ ./vtk-generator methane.check methane-homo.vtk MO HOMO

  HOW TO VISUALIZE MO
  -------------------
  The ParaView software is used to visualize MOs.
    1. Start ParaView.
    2. Choose File -> Load State
    3. Open the mo-view.pvsm file in the smash/vtk directory.
    4. Open a vtk file.
